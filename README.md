🎨 Modern CSS In-Depth
A comprehensive, hands-on guide to modern CSS features used in real-world, production-grade applications. This repository focuses on clean architecture, scalability, and component-driven design using the latest CSS standards.

Built for professional frontend and full-stack developers who want to master modern CSS beyond basics.


🚀 Why This Repository?
Modern CSS has evolved significantly. Features like Grid, Container Queries, and :has() allow developers to:

Build complex layouts without hacks

Create truly reusable components

Reduce JavaScript dependency

Improve performance and maintainability

This repository demonstrates how and when to use these features with real-world examples, not toy demos.


🧠 Topics Covered
CSS Grid (Advanced Layout Systems)
Learn to create sophisticated, responsive layouts with CSS Grid. From basic grid definitions to advanced template areas, auto-placement algorithms, and subgrid implementations.

Container Queries (Component-based Responsiveness)
Move beyond viewport-based media queries. Create components that respond to their container's size, enabling truly reusable and context-aware UI elements.

Advanced Selectors
:is() - Group selectors efficiently

:where() - Apply styles with zero specificity

:has() - Select parent elements based on child conditions (the "parent selector" finally here!)

Pseudo-elements
Master ::before and ::after for creating decorative elements, icons, and complex visual effects without extra HTML.

CSS Functions
clamp() - Fluid typography and spacing

min(), max() - Dynamic calculations

calc() - Advanced mathematical operations

Transitions & Micro-interactions
Create smooth, performant animations and subtle interactions that enhance user experience without compromising performance.
